## 01-How to Set up Vue.js project in 5 easy steps using vue-cli -##
https://medium.com/@subodhgarg/how-to-set-up-vue-js-project-in-5-easy-steps-using-vue-cli-669b1aea518b

Step 1
npm install -g @vue/cli

[npm install -g vue-cli      for vue-cli(1.x or 2.x)   ]
If you’re reading the comments to find out why you’re getting errors, or why step 2 isn’t working, allow me to help:
From the Vue CLI docs:
“The package name changed from vue-cli to @vue/cli.
If you have the previous vue-cli(1.x or 2.x) package installed globally,
you need to uninstall it first with npm uninstall vue-cli -g or yarn global remove vue-cli.”

Step 2
Syntax: vue init <template-name> <project-name>
example: vue init webpack-simple vuejs-boilerplate

Step 3
cd vuejs-boilerplate

Step 4
npm install

Step 5
npm run dev


##- 01-Basic Routing with Vue.js -##

Step 1: Install Vue Router
npm install vue-router --save

Step 2: Basic Routing with Vue.js
Inside the src folder, create one Folder router and one file called index.js and add the following code.

import Vue from 'vue';
import Router from 'vue-router';

import Home from '../components/Home.vue';
import Register from '../components/Register.vue';
import Login from '../components/Login.vue'; 

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
    routes: [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
    { path: '/register', component: Register },
    { path: '/login', component: Login },
    ]
});
export default router;


Step 3: Create Vue components
The next step is to create three new components inside the src >> components folder.
    Home.vue
    Register.vue
    Login.vue

Step 3: npm run dev

##- 02-Vue HTML 5 History Mode Routing -##

We are using the hash mode of routing. We can also use HTML 5 History Mode.
By default, vue.js uses the hash mode. We need to tell the vue application externally to do the history routing.
We need to modify one line of code inside the index.js file, and we are done.
Now, we can be able to route the components without the hash.

##- 03-Dynamic routing in Vue.js -##
Let us define one more route inside the src >> routes.js called /student/:id
and also create a component inside the src >> components folder called Student.vue.

##- 04-Named routes in Vue.js -##
We can simplify the linking process to navigating to different routes by defining
the named routes or designated routes.
Sometimes it is more convenient to identify
the route with the name, especially when linking to the route or performing navigations.
You can give the route a name in the routes options while creating a Router instance.

Now, we will add one property called name to the routes object in a index.js file.

##- 05-Redirecting Programmatically in Vue Router -##
In the single page application, we often face a situation where we need to
perform the redirecting after some operations are done successfully.

We can redirect the route programmatically using the router object.
For example, when the user successfully logged in, we need to redirect to the home route programmatically.

Let us see the following example.
Let us create one more component called Redirect.vue inside the components folder and add the following code.
